excerpt: 'Reclaimed slurs may often be used only by in-group speakers because they are tokens of a social practice of resistance or subversion,
which is alterantive to the typical bigoted practices of slur use. As a constitutive condition, what practice a given utterance is an act of may depend
on the social identity of the speaker. (This paper was an invited contribution.)'

Abstract: Given the apparent nondisplaceability and noncancellability of the derogatory content of slurs, it may appear puzzling
that non-derogatory uses of slurs exist. Moreover, these uses seem to be in general available only to in-group speakers,
thereby exhibiting a peculiar kind of context-sensitivity. In this paper the author argues that to understand non-derogatory uses
we should consider slurs in terms of the kind of social practice their uses instantiate. A suitable theory of social practices
has been proposed by McMillan. In typical (derogatory) uses the practice is one of bigotry and discrimination. Non-derogatory uses
are only possible to the extent that they consitute acts of an alternative, non-derogatory practice. In the core cases it must be
a subversive practice of satire or reappropriation. The social identity of speakers is not an ultimately decisive factor (in-group
uses may still be derogatory) but it is an important constitutive condition: most non-derogatory practices of slur-use can only
be performed by a member of the target group.
