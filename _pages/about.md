I'm a philosopher and a linguist (sort of). My main research area is in philosophy of language, especially its interfaces with linguistics on the one hand, and social philosophy on the other. Recently, I have been working on bigoted and offensive language (slurs and epithets). I also do some work in theoretical and empirical linguistics (with corpus and, in near future, experimental methods) and in classical philology.

This site is under construction. More content to be added soon. Feel free to send me an email, if you want to learn more about my work, get a pdf of a paywalled publication or just say 'hello'.
