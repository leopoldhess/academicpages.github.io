I'm a philosopher and a linguist (a little bit). My main research area is in philosophy of language, especially its interfaces with linguistics on the one hand, and social philosophy on the other. Recently, I have been working on expressive, offensive and bigoted language (slurs and epithets). I also do some work in theoretical and empirical linguistics (with corpus and, in near future, experimental methods) and in classical philology. My research in these fields is centered around the concept of perspective-taking in language, especially in narratives.

This site is under construction and includes mostly placeholder content. Updates to follow soon. In the meantime, feel free to send me an email, if you want to learn more about my work, get a pdf of a paywalled publication, or just say 'hello'.
